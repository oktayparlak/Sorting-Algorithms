## Introduction

The field of computer science relies heavily on data structures and algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for software engineers and developers.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in different programming languages. It covers a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more.

## Data Structures

The `data-structures` directory contains implementations of various data structures. Each data structure is organized into its own folder and includes the necessary code files and tests. The implementations are available in different programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

Here are some of the data structures included in this repository:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree(Coming Soon)
- Binary Search Tree(Coming Soon)
- Heap(Coming Soon)
- Graph(Coming Soon)

Feel free to explore the individual folders to find the data structure you're interested in.

## Algorithms

The `algorithms` directory contains implementations of different algorithms. Just like the data structures, each algorithm has its own folder with the necessary code files and tests. The algorithms cover a wide range of topics, including sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and more.

Some of the algorithms included in this repository are:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search(Coming Soon)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)(Coming Soon)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)(Coming Soon)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm(Coming Soon)

You can navigate to the individual algorithm folders to find the implementation in your preferred programming language.
